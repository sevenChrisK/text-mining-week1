## Overview

This is a step by step account of the practical work undertaken for KCL Text Mining module week 1.

## Preparing data

Firstly I downloaded the data tables for each year of the E-Participation Index from https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/Data-Center 

I then used UN lookup reference material to manually add a 'region' variable column to the 2022 index data.

I wrote a function to combine all the downloaded csv files into a single data frame, and then joined this with the data frame containing the region variable.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
